# GitHub User Activity

A simple CLI project to fetch the recent activity of a GitHub user and display it in the terminal. This project is part of the [Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/github-user-activity) backend project challenges. This project helped me learn JavaScript, including working with Node, APIs and handling JSON data.

## Features

- Fetch and display the user's latest Git activity:
  - Pushed commits
  - Opened issues
  - Starred repositories
  - Created new branches or repositories
  - Forked repositories


## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/IbraDoesCode/GitHub-User-Activity.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. Link the project globally
    ```
    npm link
    ```
## Usage

After installation, you can use the command-line tool to fetch a GitHub user's recent activity by running:

```
github-user-activity <username>
```
